Create a simple personal homepage with an introduction, a profile picture, and a link to your favorite website.

Explanation:

HTML:

The <html> tag is the root element of the document.
<head> contains metadata and links to CSS and JavaScript files.
<body> contains the content displayed on the webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

CSS:

The body is styled to have a light gray background, centered text, and padding.
The heading is styled with a dark blue color.
Paragraphs are styled with dark gray color.
The profile picture is styled to be circular, have a shadow, and be centered.
The link to the favorite website is styled to change color on hover.

JavaScript:

Waits for the DOM to load.
Adds an event listener to the link so that when clicked, an alert is shown and then the user is redirected to the favorite website.
