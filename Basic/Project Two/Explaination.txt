Build a contact form with name, email, and message fields, and validate the inputs using JavaScript.

Explanation

HTML:

The form consists of labels and input fields for name, email, and a message, followed by a submit button.
Each field is wrapped in a <div> for styling and layout purposes.
The id attribute is used to uniquely identify elements, which helps in linking labels and scripting.

CSS:

Basic styling to make the form look neat and visually appealing.
Focus states are styled to provide visual feedback when the user interacts with form elements.

JavaScript:

The form's submit event is captured to prevent the default form submission.
Input values are checked to ensure they are not empty.
The email is validated with a regular expression to ensure it has a valid format.
Appropriate messages are shown if any validation fails.
A success message is shown if all validations pass.
